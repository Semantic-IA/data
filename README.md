## Data Repository

In the spirit of open data, we decided to publicize the raw data we used for our paper [insert final paper title here].

It contains all relevant data from our research, including the database of patterns for our simulator, which can be found in [this Repository](https://github.com/Semantic-IA/DRQPatternAttack).

All data is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license. Feel free to use it for further research.

Due to licensing restrictions, we are unable to add the input file for our DNS pattern finder program. Please download your own copy of the [Alexa Toplist](http://www.alexa.com/topsites) and process it so that each line contains exactly one domain name before using it as input to the DNS pattern finder.

Each subfolder contains data from our research, as well as an individual README.md with further information.
