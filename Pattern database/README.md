## Pattern Database
The file pattern-database.txt contains domain name patterns in a format suitable for the simulator.

Each pattern is saved in the following way:
```
pattern1.tld:pattern1.tld,pattern-element1.tld,pattern-element2.tld,...
pattern2.tld:pattern2.tld,pattern-element1.tld,pattern-element2.tld,...
...
```

No warranty for completeness or correctness of patterns. This version of the dataset was collected in May, 2013.
